# BlueScan

Hello!

-Apple don't let us acces to the MAC address and the UUID is computed from the MAC. The UUID is linked to the the particular iOS device. The UUID cannot be used on another iOS device to identify the same peripheral.

The app have a label that show if the bluetooth of the BLE device is enable.

You can click on the button "Scan" to scan nearby BLE devices, you have the list of devices. The button is now green with a new titel label "scanning" with an activity indicator under the button, you can click again on the button to stop the scanning. When you click on a BLE device (cell) a new window show more information such as the BLE device number in the list, the name, the identifier(UUID) and the RSSI. You can swipe down to dismiss the new window and you go back to the list of BLE devices.

If you click on scan and the bluetooth is disabled a pop up tell you to enable your device bluetooth to start to scan.

Thank you!
